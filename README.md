## 👨‍💻 Installation

To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/shahadad-shishir/TodoApp.git`
- Navigate to the project directory: `cd TodoApp`
- Open the project in Visual Studio Code: `code .`
- Run the project:
  - Use the Live Server extension (for Visual Studio Code):
    - Right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server".

The app will be accessible in your browser at [http://127.0.0.1:5501/](http://127.0.0.1:5501/) (or the port assigned by your live server).

**Note:** This application is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using vanilla JavaScript. When run on a local server, such as VS Code Live Server, reloading the page with different pathnames may cause the application to not load properly due to the way SPAs handle routing. However, once deployed on hosting platforms like Netlify, this issue is resolved, and the application will function correctly across all routes.
